# blocks.css

Add some dimension to your page with blocks ðŸš€

## Synopsis

**blocks.css** is the core of styles used in my projects like [Codeframe](https://beta.codeframe.co), [Zero to Code](https://zerotocode.org), and [Lyrics.rip](https://genius.com/a/a-teen-programmer-built-a-tool-called-lyrics-rip-to-generate-fake-lyrics-for-your-favorite-artists).

## Theming

By default, Blocks are turquoise. (Why? because it's my favorite color.) But you can use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) to modify the color and add things like a dark theme.
