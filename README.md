# blocks.css ‚òïÔ∏è

Add some dimension to your page with blocks üöÄ

You can check out examples and get started with **blocks.css** at the [GitHub Page üìñ](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/). Here's what blocks.css UI looks like, from the documentation.

Start by adding the blocks.css stylesheet to your page's head:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/blocks.css/dist/blocks.min.css" />
```

## Summary

**blocks.css** is the core of styles used in my projects like [Codeframe](https://beta.codeframe.co), [Zero to Code](https://zerotocode.org), and [Lyrics.rip](https://genius.com/a/a-teen-programmer-built-a-tool-called-lyrics-rip-to-generate-fake-lyrics-for-your-favorite-artists). Lots of people asked for the styles, so I've pulled the button styles out into a separate package right here.

## Theming

blocks.css supports theming. By default, Blocks are turquoise. (Why? because it's my favorite color.) But you can use [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) to modify the color and add things like a dark theme.

Check out the [documentation](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/) for the full details.
